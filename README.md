## About Me
I started coding on an old HP laptop using code.org, where I spent months building a chat app with databases and dynamic rendering, though it never got released. That experience sparked my passion for coding, and I quickly moved on to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

After mastering the basics, I dove into Express.js and have spent over two years creating web apps, even turning them into desktop applications with Tauri and Electron. Now, with over 20 programming languages under my belt, I'm focused on building new startups for myself and others, always pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible on the web.
